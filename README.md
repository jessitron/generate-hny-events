# generate some events in Honeycomb

I need screenshots of some graphs in Honeycomb.

These represent customer data, without being customer data.
They demonstrate trends that customers have described to me. They're real Honeycomb screenshots
without risking any sort of actual data leakage.

This program generates those. I can change it to generate others.

## running

I defined HONEYCOMB_API_KEY (to an ingest key) and DATASET_NAME.

`npm start`

No guarantees.
